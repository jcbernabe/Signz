/**
 *  A segments controller mediates playback managed by a media player controller according to a list of segments
 *  it retrieves from a data source. Segments can either be blocked or visible, and the segments controller is responsible
 *  of skipping blocked segments or blocking access to them when seeking.
 *
 *  When a data source is requested for segments, it might return segments with other identifiers as well. Segments with the 
 *  same identifiers are treated as logical segments (part of a single media, and sharing its identifier), whereas segments 
 *  with different identifiers are treated as physical segments (separate medias with different identifiers). Segments which
 *  are incorrect (e.g. outside a full-length) are ignored.
 *
 *  For logical segments, the segment controller locates the largest segment and considers it as being the full-length media, 
 *  to which other segments must belong to (segments which would incorrectly not belong to it will be discarded with a warning). 
 *  It them manages playback between them transparently.
 *
 *  For physical segments, switching to another segment changes the media actually played (the previous one is stopped, and
 *  playback is started for the new one). Logical and physical segments can be freely mixed together.
 *
 *  To use a segments controller, instantiate or drop an instance in Interface Builder, and bind it to the underlying
 *  player controller. Also attach a data source from which segments will be retrieved for the media being played. When
 *  segments need to be retrieved, call `reloadSegementsForIdentifier:completionHandler:`
 *
 *  When controlling playback for a media with segments, call `RTSMediaPlayback` methods on the segment controller. For
 *  convenience, you can readily display segments as a timeline (see `RTSSegmentedTimelineView`) and / or on top of a
 *  slider (see `RTSTimelineSlider`).
